# strata-conf-scraper
Scrapes the 2018 NY Strata Data Conference attendees list for company names and URLs. Unfortunatly the paid service that we use for conference lists resulted in a very wrong list. Instead of manually scraping the list online into Excel, I made this super simple scraper to do it for us.
